This is a relocation guide that will get you started with settling down in Finland 🇫🇮. For info on visas, bank accounts, health insurance and finding a job, read on.

Taking on a new job, city, social circle and culture at once is tough. We say: less worrying about paperwork - more drinking delicious beers, enjoy *the sauna* and exploring the city and surrounding nature! Welcome to Suomi (Finland) 💙
