## Public transportation
If you need to travel by bus, metro and train there various different tickets you can buy:
Bus - you can buy tickets on board (cash only)

Metro - buy tickets in the station

24/72 hour City Pass (including transport from the airport) from 80DKK and 100DKK for adults

Rejsekort - a prepaid re-usable ticket you can top up at Rejsekort ATMs or online. Aimed primarily at residents of Denmark (you need a CPR number/to fill in paperwork and provide ID) there is also an option for short term stays (more info).
