This is version 0.1 of the guide.

The guide will be more helpful if it captures the needs and issues faced among many immigrants, which is why weâ€™re looking for feedback and hopefully partners to collaborate with on it as a joint community effort.

Sound like something you want to be part of?

**Weâ€™d love to hear about:**

ðŸ™Œ Issues youâ€™ve faced moving to / helping to settle in new recruits

ðŸ™Œ What other hacks and tricks we should include?

ðŸ™Œ Whether this would be helpful for you/your startup?

ðŸ™Œ Any other feedback just get in touch with krumhausen@gmail.com
